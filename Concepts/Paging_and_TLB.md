# Paging
Paging is a memory management scheme which allows Non-Contigous storage at physicla memory for a process. It is a solution to External Fragmentation.

It divided physical memory into fixed size frames. And Process's memory is divided into same size Pages. 

The status of each frame(filled/empty) us stored by Frame table.

Pages: Fixed-sized blocks of logical memory. The size of a page is equal to the size of a frame.

Page Size: Determined by the processor architecture. Traditionally, pages are 4,096 bytes, but modern systems may support multiple page sizes.

Page Table
A data structure that maps pages to frames.

Stores the base address of each page in physical memory.

Every logical address generated by the CPU is divided into:

Page Number (p): Used as an index into the page table to find the corresponding frame.

Page Offset (d): Used to locate the specific byte within the frame.
The page table is stored in main memory when a process is created.

The base address of the page table is stored in the Process Control Block (PCB).

A Page Table Base Register (PTBR) points to the current page table. During context-switching, only this register needs to be updated.
